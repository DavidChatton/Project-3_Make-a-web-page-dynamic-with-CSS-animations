## Objectives

1.  Develop a site offering the menu of 4 great Parisian restaurants.
2.  Allow online booking and menu composition.

## Deliverables

### Pages to be integrated according to the models

- **Home page**
- **Menu pages (x4)**

### Animation

**Buttons**
- When hovering, the background color of the main buttons should lighten slightly. The drop shadow should also be more visible.
- Eventually, visitors will be able to save their favorite menus. For this, a heart-shaped "Like" button is present on the model. When clicked, it should fill up progressively. For this first version, the effect can be shown on hover instead of click.

**Home page**
- When the application will have more menus, a loading spinner will be necessary. On this mockup, we want to have a preview of it. It will have to appear for 1 to 3 seconds when you arrive on the home page, cover the whole screen, and use CSS animations (no library). The design of this loader is not defined, so any proposal is welcome as long as it is consistent with the graphic charter of the site.

**Menu pages**
- On arrival on the page, the dishes will appear progressively with a slight delay in time. They can either appear one by one, or in groups "Starter", "Main course" and "Dessert". An example of the expected effect is provided.
- The visitor can add the dishes he wants to his order by clicking on them. A small tick appears to the right of the dish. This tick should slide from the right to the left. For this first version, the effect can appear on the hover instead of the click. If the title of the dish is too long, it should be trimmed with ellipsis. An example of the expected effect is provided
